# Encryption Algorithm

### AES
- a.k.a Advanced Encryption Standard
- Symmetric encryption
- Key sizes: 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit (AES-256)
- Usage: Encrypt sensitive data and securing message payloads

### RSA
- a.k.a Rivest–Shamir–Adleman
- Asymmetric encryption
- Usage: Used in JWT signing

### SHA-2
- a.k.a Secure Hash Algorithm 2
- Hashing algorithm for integrity and authentication
- Usage: Hashing passwords

### TLS
- a.k.a Transport Layer Security
- Usage: HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) communication between microservices
